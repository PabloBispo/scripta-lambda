# python-lambda-ecr-docker-terraform

## Introduction

This project is meant to demonstrate the working of how GitHub Actions
work with AWS Lambda, AWS ECR and Python. We employ a simple stack deployment
using Terraform and later, use GitHub Actions to automatically update the
lambda function for successive pushes.
